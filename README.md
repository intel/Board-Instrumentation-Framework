# Board-Instrumentation-Framework
This project allows you to instrument and graphically display pretty much anything you want in a flexible way. 
It consists of 3 parts, the data collector (Minion) written in Python, which sends data over a UDP socket to the data broker and recorder called Oscar, also written in Python.  The last part is a Java FX application called Marvin, which receives data from Oscar and displays it via a library of highly configurable 'widgets'.

Here are a couple of my YouTube videos that make use of this framework:

Marvin is now a Java 10+ application.  If you need Java 8, checkout the JAVA_8 branch.
